# AICoursework
This is the coursework for my Artificial Intelligence module. The task was to implement a search algorithm that is able to find the shortest path between an arbitrary number of caverns.
This is an example of a map of caverns.

There are different directions, different distances and the caverns are not aligned between each other.

## Instructions
The code expects a ".cav" file which is simply a comma separated text file. When the program finishes, it will create a ".csn" file which will contain the route and
the distance of that same route.
